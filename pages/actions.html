        <div class="son3"> <h3> Mass consumption of plastic products </h3> <p> People use a lot of plastic in their lifetime with plastic products. Therefore, the demand of plastic increases letting more and more industries create plastic products to supply the customers. Nowadays, various companies all around the world rely on plastic to create affordable, easy-to-make and flexible items.</p> </div>
        <div class="son3"> <h3> Improper waste disposal </h3> <p> Littering plastic onto the ground or in the water could cause several problems as a domino effect. Nature's courses such as the movement of tides, the wind or erosion could spread this plastic pollution if you have disposed of plastic improperly. Additionally, the plastic can harm the environment via trees or plants, marinelife and even intoxicate soil as plastic is non-biodegradable. </p> </div>
        <div class="son3"> <h3>  Agricultural and fishing norms   </h3><p> Farming and Fishing have been involved in the spread of microplastics in the ocean due to the high amounts of plastic used in plantation regarding plastic coating agents and plastic mulch. Disregarded fish gear can also end up in the ocean which can entangle marine creatures and also contaminate water which can potentially destroy ecosystems.   </p> </div>

          <h3> The 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle</h3>
          <p> Plastic may be a useful material to human industries but has a pile of negative impacts to the environments. Therefore, let's start reducing the usage of plastic in general. In the meantime, we can use alternatives to plastic. Additionally, single-use plastic items have many controversies surronding it. Thus, we can try reusing plastic items if they can be used more than once such as the plastic bags you recieve from stores, plastic bottles you obtain from covnvenience stores or even plastic containers. Last but not least, recycling is the most efficient way to turn plastic items that can't be used anymore into items new items that can even be done at home. These items may include plastic pots for your plants, plastic pencil containers and the list goes on with creations based of our imagination. </p>

          <h3> Taking care of the environment </h3>
          <p> Plastic pollution isn't just caused by the repetitive use of plastic, it can also be affected by throwing away plastic on land or even in the waters which potentially harm ecosystems as plastic is a synthetic material. Therefore, it's important to know proper waste disposal and to clean up after yourself to help both your community and environment as much as you can. Thus, there have been environmental hygiene guidelines given from environmentalists, governments or by organizations to help reduce plastic waste. Additionally, you can also show community involvement by pariticpating in events to clean up plastic near you which can creating better scenery and green spaces that can be enjoyed together.</p>

          <h3> Say no to single-use plastic items</h3>
          <p> Plastic is a synthetic material meaning it is non-biodegradable. These types of materials hurt our environment once thrown. Single-use plastic may be useful in some situations but the general use of it in day-to-day life should be regulated or even be stopped. We can reduce plastic waste by surronding ourselves with reusable items and to avoid disposables as much as you can. These actions could include taking note of the amount of plastic packaged items you buy and the items you use to consume them. Proper packaging of food and drinks with reusable materials could be helpful too. Additionally, if you were to buy items online or even recieve packages, we can always reuse the packaging around your house which could also reduce plastic waste. it's best to remember that plastic can be potentially be reused to create new things.</p>

          <h3> Take action & Educate others</h3>
          <p> Learning about plastic pollution is great but we must take action ourselves to combat against it. We can also spread awareness to others via word of mouth or even by social media by creating projects, real-life activities, videos and more to reach the audience of all around the world. You can also donate to foundations or organizations locally or internationally to show support in this movement too: We all have a role in this world to fulfill. </p>

        <div class="son4"> <h3> The United Nation's efforts </h3> <p> The United Nations (UN) consisting of over 193 countries has declared a nationwide resolution to end all plastic pollution. Critically,, the regulations have focused on measures considering the entire life cycle of plastics,  from extraction and product design to production to waste management, enabling opportunities to design out waste before it is created as part of a balanced world. They have estimated to cut off over 80 percent of plastic pollution if all countries comply to create policys and regulations regarding plastic pollution. Additionally, they have focused on reusing, diversifying and recycling plastic products to achieve it. However, there will still be heavy amounts of plastic left on Earth's surface. Therefore, they also aim on annually cleaning up the environment to help reach the goal of ending all plastic pollution.</p> </div>
        <div class="son4"> <h3> We only have one Earth </h3> <p> Nowadays, most people have forgotten that our actions affect the future of our world. Hence, we should take precaution no matter what we are doing to think if it will affect not just the environment but society too. We too have a role in this world and it is to help make a future free from environmental problems such as plastic pollution for the future generations to thrive and live happily. No matter how small of a good deed you do, it can gradually help recover Earth to as how beautiful it was in the past. Therefore, we should try helping planet Earth one way or another.</p> </p>
