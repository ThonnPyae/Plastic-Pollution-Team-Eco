        <h3>Alternatives to Plastic</h3>
        <p> Plastic is a very useful material that was made for certain occasion. However, our dependance on plastic has caused many downsides to the human health and the environment too. Therefore, corporations have researched alternatives to plastic. They include recyclable materials such as- </p>

  <div class="son"> <h3> Glass </h3> <p> Glass, the previous cornerstone of packaging drinks have become mostly irrelevant in the 21st century. Nowadays, if you try to buy drinks at stores or even store them at home, we use plastic. Although plastic has the properties to be durable and not break easily unlike glass, plastic which is derived from fossil fuels hurts the environment much more than we can think of. Therefore, substituing plastic with glass is a good choice while being made from sand meaning it is also recyclable and reusable once washed. Plastics also offer the danger of breaking into microplastics in hot temperatures which could potentially leach your food with unedible bits of material that your body can't digest well. However, glass offers 100% purity with no loss in quality. </p> <img src="../media/glass.JPG"> </div>
  <div class="son"> <h3> Liquid Wood </h3> <p> Liquid Wood is a material made by combining the cells of living organisms also known as a biopolymer material which is also an alternative to plastic and other syntehtic materials. Liquid wood possesses almost smiliar traits to plastic but is a sustainable version due to it being biodegradable, recyclable and coming from renewable sources. This material has also been applied in various facilities such as manufacturing, packaging, etc. Additionally, liquid wood is a waterproof material once dry meaning that it can be used underwater. It also has other properties such as being non-toxic, lightweight, strong and flexible which helps humans create products with it.</p> <img src="../media/LW.png"> </div>
  <div class="son"> <h3>  Bamboo  </h3><p> Although bamboo comes from plants which can account to deforestation, bamboo is widely considered a sustainable material due to its' rapid growth, low agricultural requirements and minimum harm to the planet which makes the production of bamboo efficient to harvest while having high produce of it to continue biodiversity. Bamboo is also a recycable material making it quite popular in the current market with products such as human necessities to product packaging.  </p>  <img src="../media/bamboo-4387852_1280.jpg"></div>

  </ol> </div>
<div class="alter"> <h3> Liquid Wood</h3> <p>  Liquid wood is generally a durable material that can compete against the properties of plastic. Thus, it is generally used in manufacturing. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Liquid wood is used to glue materials or items together underwater or as a substance to stick items to a surface such as mounting mirrors to a wall or fixing cracked pots. </li>
    <li> It is also used as the framework for creating cabinets, door panels and other furniture assets.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
